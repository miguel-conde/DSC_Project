# ABOUT

This [Shiny][1] application is my Project for the [Coursera's][3] "[Data Science Capstone][2]", final part of the [Data Science Specialization][4].

Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. [SwiftKey][7], our corporate partner in this capstone, builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices. One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models. When someone types:

*I went to the*

the keyboard presents three options for what the next word might be. For example, the three words might be *gym*, *store*, *restaurant*. 

In this capstone we've worked  on understanding and building predictive text models like those used by [SwiftKey][7] to finally build a predictive text product.

In other words, the goal of the Capstone Project is to create a predictive text product, that implements a predictive text model and algorithm built from analyzing a large corpus of text documents, to provide an interface that can be accessed by others.

The data is from a corpus called [HC Corpora][5]. See the [readme file][6]  for details on the corpora available.

The files are named LOCALE.[blogs|news|twitter].txt where LOCALE is each of the four locales en_US, de_DE, ru_RU and fi_FI.

Just en_US files have been modelled.
